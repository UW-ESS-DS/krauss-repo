1)	What is the scientific objective?
2)	What is the state-of-the-art tool in the discipline?
3)	Describe the data type, size, and the data archive that you intend to use. Cite the literature and the dataset with their DOIs. 

Can ML be used to pick P- and S-waves in ocean bottom seismometer data for a mid-ocean ridge? Can ML be used to distinguish P- and S-waves from oceanographic, 

Workflow description:

Compile phase pick data into an intuitive, relatively small and simple data structure

Split data into training and validation sets

Construct ML architecture to train

Train dataset

Evaluate successes and failures of ML architecture using the validation set

Iterate and improve ML architecture (?)

Compare performance of ML algorithm to our home-grown Matlab code
---------------------------------------------------------
Questions for Marine and Ariane:
What do my data need to look like? Do I just need the times of the phase picks? We have never locally stored the time series. What gets fed to the ML?

If I just want to use a phase picker, what “style” of ML do I start with? PhaseNet was deep-neural-network, is that just what tensor flow is?

Describing a workflow: how much iteration goes into the architecture? How much design is done before you just "start"?

What is a feasible goal for this quarter? How should I angle my objective towards general noise/phase picking/generalizability to other areas? Can I shoot for higher-level stuff like looking for LFEs?
